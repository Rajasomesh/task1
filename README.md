# 🌐 Responsive Landing Page - Internship Task 1

Hi! This is a simple and clean **responsive landing page** I built using only **HTML** and **CSS**.  
It's part of my web development internship, and helped me practice building layouts, using Flexbox, and making websites responsive without any frameworks like Bootstrap.
